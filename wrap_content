For my mobile layout, I need to use wrap_content
There are lots of different screen sizes phones tablets laptops and so on. we need to fit the screen size all devices.
That's why we need to use "wrap_content". 

If i use wrap_content for widht and height it only takes the content within that view.Not full space or full screen.
